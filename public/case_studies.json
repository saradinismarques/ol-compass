In particular, when a player finds a pair of identical cards, the opponent reads him the corresponding question and checks that the answer is correct. For each correct answer the player wins the cards pair, otherwise the correct answer is read aloud and the cards are turned over. The player with more cards pairs wins. [IT, EN]",
