    "#long-version": "The Ocean is one body of water made of diverse ocean basins overall covering the 70% of the Earth's surface. Each ocean basin presents a peculiar set of geological features. The Ocean's interconnected circulation system affects climate and ecosystems. Sea level varies with temperature changes and tectonic activity. Seawater is 97% of the Earth’s hydrosphere, and its pH balance vital for marine life and carbon sequestration. The Ocean is part of the water cycle through evaporation and precipitation processes. It is connected with all major watersheds, thus exchanges with them nutrients and pollutants. Despite its vastness, the Ocean is finite."

    "#long-version": "Many Earth's materials and biogeochemical cycles originate in the Ocean. Sea level changes over time have expanded and contracted continental shelves, created and destroyed inland seas, and shaped our inner and coastal lands. Together with wind and tectonic processes, waves and currents determine erosion. Most beach sand is eroded from land sources and carried to the coast by rivers; currents redistribute sand seasonally. The Ocean is the largest reservoir of carbon on Earth. Many organisms use carbon dissolved in the Ocean to form shells, other skeletal parts, and coral reefs."

    "#long-version": "The Ocean-atmosphere interactions regulate the Earth’s energy, water, and carbon systems. By absorbing most of the solar radiation reaching Earth, the Ocean moderates global weather and climate. Changes in the Ocean’s circulation produced abrupt changes in climate in the last 50,000 years. Most rain that falls on land originally evaporated from the tropical Ocean. Condensation of warm evaporated water fuels hurricanes and cyclones.  The Ocean absorbs roughly half of all carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Changes in the Ocean-atmosphere system can endanger the climate balance. that in turn cause further changes to the Ocean and atmosphere, resulting in a vicious cycle with dramatic geochemical, biological, economic, and social consequences."

The Ocean offers many unique examples of life cycles, adaptations and interdependent organisms. Most of the living space on Earth is in the Ocean, diversely distributed from its surface down to (and below) its seafloor. A few Ocean regions host the most abundant life on Earth, while most of the Ocean does not support much life. Some deep Ocean ecosystems are bioluminescent. Zonation patterns influence organisms’ distribution and diversity. Estuaries provide important and productive nursery areas for many marine species."

It is a means of livelihood, economic development, transport and security. It is a source of inspiration, recreation and cultural heritage. Humans are largely responsible for ocean acidification, pollution, shores erosion and marine species depletion. Human-caused changes in Ocean temperature and pH threaten the survival of some organisms, hence reducing biological diversity. Much of the world’s population lives in coastal areas which are susceptible to natural hazards. Taking care of the Ocean is everyone's responsibility and requires both individual and collective action."
