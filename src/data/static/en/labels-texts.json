You are required to <b>say aloud what the given function does</b> before moving to the next. <br><br> <b>STEP 2 (15’): MAP OL-RELATED ACTIVITY</b> <br> Spend some time deepening your OL knowledge with the <b>final goal of mapping an OL-related didactic activity</b> <c>that you carried out.</c> <br> You can move freely across functions. <br><br> NB You are not expected to absorb as much information as possible, but to simply navigate OL knowledge based on your curiosity and interests.<br><br> If you feel stuck, you can ask us for help. <br><b>Please always think aloud</b>, and enjoy!",
